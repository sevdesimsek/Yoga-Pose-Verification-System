Developed a desktop application using PyTorch, PyQt5, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for verifying yoga poses. Students upload images for feedback, while instructors review submissions. The app features a CNN model for pose classification and validation, and utilizes SQLite for data storage. This project highlights skills in deep learning, CNNs, UI design, and database management.
